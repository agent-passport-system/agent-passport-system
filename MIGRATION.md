# Migration to 8.0.0: Cycles receipt to envelope correspondence

Correspondence applies to permit and release receipts verified with an envelope,
supplied through `options.evidence` or fetched by the `*WithEvidence` verifiers.
Denials get no correspondence check. The receipt shape checks below apply to
every Cycles verifier, with or without an envelope, and the evidence-result
hardening applies to every `*WithEvidence` verifier, denials included.

## What changed

`verifyCyclesPermitReceipt`, `verifyCyclesReleaseReceipt` and their `WithDID`
forms now check, after the hash binding and the envelope signature, that the
supplied envelope is the event the receipt references:

- a permit receipt needs a `reserve` envelope whose
  `payload.reserve.response.reservation_id` equals the receipt's `reservation_id`
- a release receipt needs a `release` envelope whose
  `payload.release.reservation_id` equals the receipt's `reservation_id`
- the envelope's single payload variant must agree with its `artifact_type`

A previously valid result becomes `valid: false` with one of two new reasons:

- `EVIDENCE_CORRESPONDENCE_FIELD_MISSING` when a field the check needs is absent
  or malformed (the envelope's `artifact_type`, its payload variant, that
  variant's reservation_id, or the receipt's own `reservation_id`)
- `EVIDENCE_CORRESPONDENCE_MISMATCH` when the stage differs, the payload variant
  disagrees with `artifact_type`, or the reservation_id differs

`detail` names the field. A match means stage and reservation_id agree. Amount,
unit, action and server identity are not compared.

Permit and release verification first captures the receipt and any envelope
as their canonical JSON, the form the hash and the signatures cover, parsed into
prototype-free records. Every check then reads only that capture. A value
reachable by JavaScript property lookup but absent from that form (inherited,
non-enumerable, on `Object.prototype`, or inside a non-JSON container such as a
`Date`) counts as missing. Which stage is required comes from the verifier you
call, never from a field of the input.

If capture fails, verification stops with a structured result and reads nothing
further. A receipt with no canonical JSON form is `SIGNATURE_INVALID`, also when
no envelope is supplied. A supplied envelope with none is
`EVIDENCE_REF_HASH_MISMATCH`. A fetched envelope with none resolves as
`malformed`. Previously such inputs could throw. Plain parsed JSON is
unaffected.

The permit and release verifiers read each supported option once, by ordinary
property lookup as before, so options supplied through a prototype or as
non-enumerable properties still apply. A receipt whose `cycles_evidence` or
`scope_of_claim` is not an object is `MISSING_REQUIRED_FIELD`, and on the permit
and release `WithEvidence` paths a non-object evidence reference is reported
`malformed` without being resolved. The `scope_of_claim` check applies to all three receipt
kinds.

On every `WithEvidence` path, a resolver failure can only report a failure
status (`not_found`, `unreachable` or `malformed`). Any other reported status,
including `matched`, becomes `malformed`. Correspondence and signer authority read
only an envelope the resolution result itself carries, and correspondence also
requires `evidence.resolved === true`. A resolver answer counts only through its
own properties: success needs its own `ok: true` and its own `envelope`, and a
non-object answer is `malformed`. A key resolver answer likewise needs its own
`ok: true` and its own string `publicKeyHex` before signer authority can be
`authentic`, and a non-object answer is `signer_resolution_failed` rather than an
exception. The evidence descriptor is a prototype-free object. Prototype-free objects
(`evidence.envelope` on permit and release paths, and the descriptor) have no
`hasOwnProperty` method and do not compare equal to ordinary objects under
prototype-sensitive deep equality. Compare their fields instead.

The `*WithEvidence` results gain a `correspondence` field evaluated on the
fetched envelope when resolution matched. It is additive: `verify`, `evidence`
and `authority` keep their meanings, so a receipt can verify while
`correspondence.status` is `mismatch`. New exported type:
`CyclesEvidenceCorrespondence`. For permit and release receipts,
`evidence.envelope` is now the captured record that was hashed and checked, a
new prototype-free object rather than the one your resolver returned. Read its
fields directly, or use `Object.prototype.hasOwnProperty.call`, since it has no
`hasOwnProperty` method of its own.

## What to do

- If you pass `options.evidence`, pass the envelope of the event the receipt
  references, not a later or earlier stage of the reservation.
- If you match on `reason`, handle the two new values.
- If you use the `*WithEvidence` paths, `verify.valid` covers the receipt alone.
  To accept a permit or release receipt together with its fetched envelope,
  require `verify.valid`, `evidence.status === 'matched'` and
  `correspondence.status === 'matched'`. For a denial, `correspondence` is always
  `not_applicable`, so require only the first two. None of these establishes that the
  envelope's signer is authorized. When your claim needs that, also require the
  `authority` disposition you accept (for example `authentic`).

# Migration to 8.0.0: external action-ref v1 input checks

This applies only to callers of `computeExternalActionRefV1`, the external
cross-ecosystem `action_ref` v1 helper. The APS-native `computeActionRef` and
every other export are unchanged.

## What changed

`computeExternalActionRefV1` now rejects, with an error containing
`OUT_OF_PROFILE_DOMAIN`, two kinds of input it used to hash:

- a non-ASCII `agentId`, `actionType` or `scope`
- an empty `scope`

Every other rejection by the helper also gains the `OUT_OF_PROFILE_DOMAIN`
marker at the start of its message. The text after the marker is unchanged.
Digests for inputs that are still accepted are unchanged.

New export: `parseExternalActionRefV1Preimage(json)` parses serialized preimage
bytes and rejects duplicate keys and a non-object top level.

## What to do

- If you pass user text or display names as `actionType` or `scope`, map them
  to an ASCII label before calling the helper, or handle the error.
- If you used `""` for "no scope", pass a non-empty label instead. Any
  `action_ref` you computed over an empty or non-ASCII value cannot be
  reproduced by a verifier that follows the pinned profile.
- If you parse preimages from the wire, use `parseExternalActionRefV1Preimage`
  instead of `JSON.parse`, so duplicate keys are refused.
- If you match on error wording, match on `OUT_OF_PROFILE_DOMAIN`.

# Migration from v1.x to v2.0

v2.0 separates the Agent Passport protocol (public SDK) from the reference
gateway implementation (private product). This enables Linux Foundation
stewardship of the protocol while preserving commercial gateway work.

## TL;DR for most consumers

If you only use the core protocol primitives — `createDelegation`,
`verifyDelegation`, `subDelegate`, `scopeAuthorizes`, `scopeCovers`,
`createReceipt`, `verifyReceipt`, `verifyRevocation`, passport creation and
verification, any crypto primitive, or any type export — **nothing changes**.
Upgrade to v2.0 and keep using the same API.

What moved is the stateful, product-side half of the system: long-running
registries, analytics, workflow state machines, and compliance automation.
Those live in `@aeoess/gateway` now.

## What stayed in the SDK (preserved signatures)

### Delegation & authority
- `createDelegation`, `verifyDelegation`, `subDelegate`
- `scopeAuthorizes`, `scopeCovers`
- `createReceipt`, `verifyReceipt`, `verifyRevocation`
- All delegation, scope, receipt, and revocation **types**

Note: `verifyDelegation` is now a pure signature + expiry + notBefore check.
Revocation status is drawn exclusively from `opts.cachedRevocationState`.
Without a cached state, `revoked=false`. Cascade semantics require a
`DelegationStore` from `@aeoess/gateway`.

### Crypto & identity
- All Ed25519 / did:key / did:web / SPIFFE primitives
- All JWS / JWKS / rotation-chain functions
- Passport issuance, verification, VC/VP export

### Reputation primitives
- `computeEffectiveScore`, `createScopedReputation`
- `DEFAULT_K`, `MAX_SIGMA`, `INITIAL_MU`, `INITIAL_SIGMA`, `SCARRING_PENALTY`
- Tier definitions, `resolveAuthorityTier`, `classifyEvidence`
- `DEFAULT_PROMOTION_REQUIREMENTS`, `meetsPromotionRequirements`
- `updateReputationFromResult`, `applyTemporalDecay`

### Attribution primitives
- Merkle tree construction, proofs, `traceBeneficiary`
- `AttributionReceipt`, `signAttributionConsent`, `verifyAttributionConsent`
- `createAttributionReceipt`, `checkArtifactCitations`

### v2 primitives
- `signAttestation`, `assessV2AttestationQuality`
- `STOPWORDS`, `extractKeywords`, `computeSemanticDrift` (pure math)
- `evaluateSemanticConstraints` (pure predicate)
- `validateV2UncertaintyCompliance`
- `isV2MigrationFactorCompatible`
- All v2 types
- `human-escalation` module (kept whole — no state)
- `delegation-v2`, `emergency-v2`, `outcome-v2` modules (kept whole)
- `wallet-binding`, `provisional-statement`, `attribution-consent`,
  `attribution-settlement`

### Adapters (pure primitives)
- `a2a`, `adk`, `crewai` (v2 IBAC-pattern), `langchain` (v2 IBAC-pattern)
- `mcp`, `gonka`, `ibac`, `ibac-cedar`, `openshell`

### Credential check
- `verifyOnAccept`, `evaluateCredentialCheck`, `resolveCheckMode`
- `AcceptanceStamp`, `CredentialCheckMode`, `CredentialCheckPolicy`,
  `CredentialCheckResult`, `CredentialCheckDenialCode`

## Shape changes within preserved primitives

Some primitives stayed in the SDK but changed field-level shape.
Surfaced in response to partner cross-version compat tests (MoltyCel,
issue #16). Field-level diffs are enumerated here so consumers parsing
v1 output structures can port their parsers cleanly.

### Wallet binding: `wallet_ref` field diff (v1 → v2)

The `wallet-binding` primitive is preserved in v2, but the shape of the
`wallet_ref` record (the per-wallet entry inside `passport.bound_wallets`)
changed. Consumers that parse `wallet_ref.signature` or `wallet_ref.nonce`
from v1 attestations will see those fields missing in v2 output.

| Field | v1.x | v2.x | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| `address` | ✓ | ✓ | preserved |
| `chain` | ✓ | ✓ | preserved |
| `signature` | ✓ | removed | v1 field: raw wallet signature over nonce |
| `nonce` | ✓ | removed | v1 field: challenge bytes |
| `binding_signature` | — | added | v2 field: passport-key Ed25519 signature over the canonical binding payload (hex) |
| `bound_at` | — | added | v2 field: ISO 8601 timestamp, part of the canonical binding payload |

The semantic shift is intentional and strengthens the primitive: v1
bound wallets with a raw wallet signature (any holder of the wallet
key could produce one); v2 binds wallets with a passport-key signature
over a canonical binding payload (only the passport holder can produce
one, and the binding is cryptographically attributable to the identity
that made it).

**Verifier API reminder.** `verifyBoundWallet` takes positional
arguments, not a config object:

```ts
verifyBoundWallet(
  passport: SignedPassport,
  chain: WalletChain,
  address: string
): boolean
```

Returns `true` for any wallet currently bound to the passport.
Passing a config object (e.g. `verifyBoundWallet({ passport, chain,
address })`) will fail the internal lookup because the positional
slots for `chain` and `address` are `undefined`. The asymmetry with
`bindWallet` (which does accept a config object) is resolved in
v2.1.0 — both forms supported.

### Verdicts that used to stand in for "not checked"

Four verification surfaces returned a permissive verdict when a check had
not run. Each now separates "checked and passed" from "not checked", and
each fails closed where it used to fail open. Consumers that relied on the
permissive reading have to state their trust posture explicitly.

| Surface | Was | Is |
|---|---|---|
| `verifyApsTxt(doc)` with no public key | `{ valid: true, errors: [] }` | `{ valid: false, signatureChecked: false, reason: 'UNSIGNED' }` |
| `verifyDelegation(d, { revocationCheckPolicy: 'fail_closed' })` | identical to `fail_open`; accepted absent and stale revocation evidence | admits only against evidence present and inside `cacheGraceMs`; result carries `revocationEvidence` |
| `verifyAgoraMessage(msg, registry)` for an unlisted author | `{ valid: true, errors: ['Author not found in agent registry'] }` | `{ valid: false, signatureValid: true, knownAgent: false }` |
| `evaluateRequest(passport, opts)` with no trust anchors | admitted the self-signed passport | denies with `UNTRUSTED_ISSUER` unless `trustedIssuers` is non-empty or `allowSelfSigned: true` |
| the MCP, LangChain, CrewAI, Gonka and A2A gates with no trust anchors | admitted, ran the tool, minted a success receipt | deny unless `trustedIssuers` is non-empty or `allowSelfSigned: true` |
| `verifyDelegation` with `cacheGraceMs: Infinity` and an unparseable `checkedAt` | graded `fresh`, satisfied `fail_closed` | graded `stale`, refused |
| `verifyDelegation` with a typo'd policy such as `'FAIL_CLOSED'` | silently meant `fail_open` | throws |
| any gate with `trustedIssuers: {}`, `new Set([...])`, `NaN`, `0` or `true` | admitted everyone silently | denies with a reason naming the option |
| `verifySocialContract` with a malformed `trustedIssuers` | discarded the option; `overall: true`, `issuerErrors: []` | `issuerChecked: true`, `issuerTrusted: false`, `overall: false`, `issuerErrors` names the option (5.0.1) |
| `verifyPassport` with a malformed `trustedIssuers` | ignored it, kept `valid: true` | `valid: false`, error names the option |
| `GovernanceLoadPolicy.allowedIssuers: []` | skipped the check, admitted any issuer | admits none; write `['*']` (`ANY_ISSUER`) alone for wildcard trust |

Porting notes:

- Reading an aps.txt without authenticating it is `parseApsTxt`, which is
  what it was always for. `verifyApsTxt` is not a parser. Its `strict`
  option and `VerifyApsTxtOptions` are removed: once the unsigned verdict
  became unconditional, `strict` changed only the length of the `errors`
  array, and a security-shaped option that cannot change a security outcome
  is the thing this work exists to delete.
- A caller who wants the old `fail_closed` behaviour wanted `fail_open`;
  say so. A caller who genuinely wants fail-closed revocation has to supply
  `cachedRevocationState` from a live source. The posture is selectable
  from `subDelegate`, `createReceipt`, `verifyOnAccept`, `consultAdvisor`
  and the LangChain, CrewAI, Gonka and MCP adapters through a `revocation`
  field, all defaulting to `fail_open`.
- `evaluateRequest` on a closed network or a development gate takes
  `allowSelfSigned: true`. Every admit made that way carries the verifier's
  self-signed warning in `GateDecision.warnings`, which the gate used to
  discard.
- **Trust anchors must be an ARRAY of key strings.** A Set, a Map, an object
  or a bare key string is now a configuration error that denies, where it used
  to disable the issuer check silently. If you hold anchors in a Set, pass
  `[...mySet]`. `normalizeTrustAnchors` is exported if you want to validate a
  value before handing it over. In 5.0.0 this held at `verifyPassport`,
  `checkPassportTrustPosture`, the five adapter gates and the relying-party
  middleware, but NOT at `verifySocialContract`, which was a third reader of
  the option and was missed; the 5.0.0 release closes it. If you read
  `TrustVerification.overall` — deprecated, and the field this affected — a
  malformed anchor list used to leave it `true`.
- **The same posture is now required at the five adapter gates.** If you call
  `governMCPToolCall`, `governLangChainTool`, `verifyCrewMember`,
  `verifyGonkaHost` or `verifyA2AIdentity`, add `trustedIssuers: [...]` or
  `allowSelfSigned: true` to the config. Without one they deny, because a
  signature that verifies under a key the passport itself supplied is a
  self-issued claim of authority, not an authorization. The rule is one shared
  function, `checkPassportTrustPosture`, exported from the package root for
  anyone building their own gate.

### allowedIssuers: how the wildcard behaves under the spread idiom

An earlier draft of this note said that "only a policy that hand-wrote
`allowedIssuers: []` changes meaning". **That was wrong and it was the more
dangerous half of the change.** `'*'` survives array concatenation, so the
idiom an operator uses to HARDEN a policy

```ts
{ ...DEFAULT_LOAD_POLICY,
  allowedIssuers: [...DEFAULT_LOAD_POLICY.allowedIssuers, myKey] }
```

produced `['*', myKey]`, which admitted every issuer. The operator's own key
was appended to a list that no longer restricted anything. `tests/governance.test.ts`
spreads the default at eight sites, so the idiom is native to this codebase.

The wildcard is now honoured ONLY as the sole entry. Naming any issuer
alongside it means the operator named issuers, so the list is read as a
closed allowlist of the named ones and the ignored wildcard is reported in
`GovernanceVerification.warnings`. Every idiom now lands where it reads:

| Policy | Admits |
|---|---|
| `DEFAULT_LOAD_POLICY` | any issuer (unchanged) |
| `{...DEFAULT, allowedIssuers: [...DEFAULT.allowedIssuers, k]}` | **only `k`** |
| `{...DEFAULT, allowedIssuers: [k]}` | only `k` |
| `{...DEFAULT, allowedIssuers: []}` | nobody |
| `{allowedIssuers: ['*']}` | any issuer |

### Type-level breaks

Result interfaces gained required members. Code that READS these results is
unaffected. Code that CONSTRUCTS one, which in practice means test doubles,
mocks and re-implementations, must add them.

| Interface | Added / changed |
|---|---|
| `AgoraVerification` | required `signatureValid`, `registryChecked` |
| `VerifyApsTxtResult` | required `signatureChecked` |
| `GovernanceVerification` | required `warnings` |
| `TrustVerification` | required `issuerChecked`, `issuerTrusted`, `issuerErrors`, `structurallyValid`; `identity` gained required `warnings`; `overall` is an accessor that emits a `DeprecationWarning` |
| `GateDenyReason` | union widened with `UNTRUSTED_ISSUER`; an exhaustive `switch` over it no longer compiles without a new branch |
| `DelegationStatus` | optional `revocationEvidence` |
| `VerificationResult` | optional `issuerTrustChecked`, `selfSignedAccepted` |
| `VerifyApsTxtOptions` | **removed**, along with the third parameter of `verifyApsTxt` |

### Still open: verifyPassport and self-signed passports

`verifyPassport(signed)` with no `trustedIssuers` still returns `valid: true`
for a self-signed passport declaring `admin:everything`. Closing that default
fails 71 tests across accountability, payment rails, mutual-auth and the
adapters, so it is a protocol decision rather than a local repair and it has
not been taken here.

What changed is that the state is machine-readable:
`VerificationResult.issuerTrustChecked` says whether a trust root was
consulted and `.selfSignedAccepted` says the verdict rests on the passport's
own signature alone. Branch on those rather than string-matching the warning.
The relying-party gate and `verifySocialContract` both do, and neither will
admit on that basis without an explicit posture from its own caller.

## What moved to @aeoess/gateway

### Data lifecycle (commit 4b710c4)

`ProxyGateway` was already moved in af6c02d. This commit moved the
remaining data-lifecycle product chain.

#### `AgentContext` / `createAgentContext`

Reason: stateful per-agent context binding; product intelligence.

```ts
// Before (v1.x)
import { createAgentContext, AgentContext } from 'agent-passport-system'

// After (v2.0)
import { createAgentContext, AgentContext } from '@aeoess/gateway'
```

#### `DataEnforcementGate`

Reason: stateful receipt/access ledger; gateway enforcement surface.

```ts
// Before
import { DataEnforcementGate } from 'agent-passport-system'

// After
import { DataEnforcementGate } from '@aeoess/gateway'
```

SDK retains `DataAccessRequest`, `DataAccessDecision`,
`DataEnforcementConfig`, `DataGatewayConfig`, `TermsAcceptance` as
interface types so the compile-time contract stays shared.

#### `DataGateway`

Reason: terms-of-access state machine + acceptance ledger.

```ts
// Before
import { DataGateway } from 'agent-passport-system'

// After
import { DataGateway } from '@aeoess/gateway'
```

#### `ContributionLedger` / `createContributionLedger` / `recordContribution` / `queryContributions` / `getSourceMetrics` / `getAgentDataFootprint`

Reason: training attribution is product intelligence (the "pixel for data in
the agent economy"). Primitives for signed contribution receipts stay; the
ledger and analytics move.

```ts
// Before
import { createContributionLedger, recordContribution } from 'agent-passport-system'

// After
import { createContributionLedger, recordContribution } from '@aeoess/gateway'
```

#### `SettlementGenerator` / `generateSettlement` / `verifySettlement` / `generateDataComplianceReport`

Reason: settlement computation and compliance reports are product intelligence.

```ts
// Before
import { generateSettlement } from 'agent-passport-system'

// After
import { generateSettlement } from '@aeoess/gateway'
```

#### `IntentNetwork` / `createIntentNetwork` / `createIntentCard` / `verifyIntentCard` / `publishCard` / `removeCard` / `computeRelevance` / `searchMatches` / `requestIntro` / `respondToIntro` / `getDigest`

Reason: cross-tenant discovery and matching is commercial surface.

```ts
// Before
import { createIntentNetwork, searchMatches } from 'agent-passport-system'

// After
import { createIntentNetwork, searchMatches } from '@aeoess/gateway'
```

#### EU AI Act mapping: `classifyRisk`, `mapArticles`, `generateTransparencyDisclosure`, `generateComplianceProfile`, `identifyGaps`, `generateComplianceReport`

Reason: compliance automation is gateway product, not protocol.

```ts
// Before
import { classifyRisk, generateComplianceReport } from 'agent-passport-system'

// After
import { classifyRisk, generateComplianceReport } from '@aeoess/gateway'
```

#### Training attribution — `createTrainingAttribution`, `createTrainingLedger`, `recordTrainingAttribution`, `getModelDataSources`, `createDerivation`, `createDerivationStore`, `recordDerivation`, `resolveAttributionChain`

```ts
// Before
import { recordTrainingAttribution } from 'agent-passport-system'

// After
import { recordTrainingAttribution } from '@aeoess/gateway'
```

#### Integration bridges — `commerceWithIntent`, `commerceReceiptToActionReceipt`, `validateCommerceDelegation`, `coordinationToAgora`, `postTaskCreated`, `postReviewCompleted`, `postTaskCompleted`

Reason: cross-module product orchestration.

```ts
// Before
import { commerceWithIntent } from 'agent-passport-system'

// After
import { commerceWithIntent } from '@aeoess/gateway'
```

### ProxyGateway (commit af6c02d)

The 105 KB runtime `ProxyGateway` implementation moved to
`@aeoess/gateway`. SDK keeps the interface contract in
`src/types/gateway.ts`.

```ts
// Before
import { ProxyGateway, createProxyGateway } from 'agent-passport-system'

// After
import { ProxyGateway, createProxyGateway } from '@aeoess/gateway'
```

### Governance hook + gateway reporter (commit a731f34)

The stateful `GovernanceHook` class and the hosted
`reportReceipt`/`reportEvaluation` helpers moved. Adapters now rely on the
existing `onReceipt`/`onDenied` callbacks.

```ts
// Before
import { GovernanceHook, reportReceipt } from 'agent-passport-system'

// After
import { GovernanceHook, reportReceipt } from '@aeoess/gateway'
```

### 18 v2 behavioral analytics modules (commit e0c009a)

Moved: `approval-fatigue`, `emergence`, `governance-drift`,
`effect-enforcement`, `root-transition`, `cascade-correlation`,
`composite-audit`, `values-override`, `blind-evaluation`, `affected-party`,
`effect-sampling`, `circuit-breakers`, `output-proportionality`,
`amendment`, `inaction-audit`, `externality`, `separation-of-powers`,
`cross-chain-audit`.

```ts
// Before
import { trackApprovalFatigue } from 'agent-passport-system'

// After
import { trackApprovalFatigue } from '@aeoess/gateway'
```

### Reputation analytics (commit 16ff1e1)

Primitives stayed. Drift analytics, consistency scoring, the promotion
review workflow, and demotion triggers moved.

### Attribution reports (commit 1e61b92)

Merkle primitives stayed. Moved: `computeAttribution`,
`computeCollaborationAttribution`, `DEFAULT_SCOPE_WEIGHTS`,
`RESULT_MULTIPLIER`.

```ts
// Before
import { computeAttribution } from 'agent-passport-system'

// After
import { computeAttribution } from '@aeoess/gateway'
```

### Delegation store (commit d6d2ab7)

Module-scope registries (`revocationRegistry`, `receiptStore`,
`chainRegistry`, `spendTracker`, `revocationListeners`) moved into a
`DelegationStore` class. Cascade revocation, chain validation, receipt
storage, spend accumulation, and batch revocation follow.

```ts
// Before
import { revokeDelegation, getReceipts, getDescendants } from 'agent-passport-system'
// revocation registry was module-scope

// After
import { DelegationStore } from '@aeoess/gateway'
const store = new DelegationStore()
store.revokeDelegation(...)
store.getReceipts(...)
```

Moved: `revokeDelegation`, `cascadeRevoke`, `batchRevokeByAgent`,
`getRevocation`, `getDescendants`, `registerRevocationListener`, `getChain`,
`getReceipts`, `addReceipt`, `getSpent`.

Internal SDK adaptation: `rotateAndInvalidate` now takes an optional
`cascadeRevoke` callback. Callers pass `DelegationStore`'s bound method.

### v2 AMBIGUOUS splits (commit c91ae5d)

Per-file: primitives stay, stateful parts move.

- `semantic-drift.ts` → stateful intent-record ledger + aggregate queries
  move to gateway `semantic-drift-tracker.ts`. Pure math stays.
- `semantic-scoping.ts` → scope registry + violation ledger move to
  gateway `scope-violations.ts`. Types + `evaluateSemanticConstraints` stay.
- `anomaly-v2.ts` → action-history ledger + concentration scoring move to
  gateway `anomaly-detection.ts`. `validateV2UncertaintyCompliance` stays.
- `migration-v2.ts` → request store + approval state machine + probation +
  lineage move to gateway `migration-workflow.ts`. Types stay.
- `attestation-v2.ts` → attestation ledger + aggregate queries move to
  gateway `attestation-ledger.ts`. `signAttestation` +
  `assessV2AttestationQuality` stay.

### 6 core AMBIGUOUS splits (commit 4a0467d)

- `commerce.ts` → gate predicates stay. `commercePreflight` pipeline moves.
- `receipt-ledger.ts` → Merkle primitives stay. `ReceiptLedger` class moves.
- `governance-posture.ts` → tier types stay. Downgrade state machine moves.
- `time.ts` → timestamp math stays pure. `logicalCounter` extracted to
  gateway `LogicalClock`.
- `entity-verification.ts` → pure `verify` stays. `didCache` extracted.
- `data-source-attribution.ts` → Merkle + equal-weight model stay. Weighted
  models move.

### Health thresholds (commit f12a9f4)

`deriveHealthStatus` + threshold constants moved to gateway
`health-policy.ts`. SDK retains only the `AgentHealthStatus` interface.

## What moved per commit

| Commit | Scope |
|--------|-------|
| `f12a9f4` | Extract health thresholds from `types/` |
| `e0c009a` | Move 18 v2 behavioral analytics to gateway |
| `a731f34` | Move governance-hook + gateway-reporter to gateway |
| `af6c02d` | Move `ProxyGateway` class to gateway |
| `4b710c4` | Move data lifecycle product chain to gateway |
| `ec92a1c` | Expose primitives needed by migrated gateway code |
| `16ff1e1` | Split `reputation-authority` into SDK primitive + gateway analytics |
| `1e61b92` | Split attribution — Merkle stays, report generators move |
| `d6d2ab7` | Split `delegation.ts` — registries move to `DelegationStore` |
| `c91ae5d` | Split 6 v2 AMBIGUOUS files — primitives stay, product moves |
| `4a0467d` | Split 6 core AMBIGUOUS files — primitives stay, product moves |

## Deprecation stubs

The SDK still exports the names of moved functions and classes. They throw
at runtime with a clear message pointing at `@aeoess/gateway`. This gives
you compile-time visibility (imports still type-check) and a loud,
unmistakable error at the call site if you try to invoke one without
migrating.

Example:

```ts
import { ProxyGateway } from 'agent-passport-system'
const g = new ProxyGateway({})
// throws: "ProxyGateway class moved to @aeoess/gateway. See MIGRATION.md"
```

Plan to migrate your imports before v2.1, when the stubs are removed.

## Timeline

- **v2.0.0-beta.0**: Published to npm `next` tag.
- **48–72h partner test window**: AgentID, MolTrust, Microsoft AGT, Google
  ADK adapter path, InsumerAPI, Kanoniv.
- **v2.0.0 final**: Promoted to `latest` tag if the window stays clean.
- **v1.46.x**: Remains on `legacy-v1` tag for 6 months. Pin there if you
  cannot migrate yet.
- **v2.1**: Deprecation stubs removed. Import from `@aeoess/gateway` before
  this release.

## Appendix: Full stub manifest

The following symbols are retained in the SDK as deprecation stubs that
throw at runtime (or at module-import time). They preserve import paths
so partners see a clear migration error, not a cryptic "module not found."

Stubs are grouped by file. Root-reachable stubs are re-exported from
`src/index.ts` — `import { X } from 'agent-passport-system'` still
type-checks but throws at call time. Subpath-only stubs require
`import { X } from 'agent-passport-system/<subpath>'`; importing them via
the root fails at compile time, which is the intended signal that your
integration needs to move to `@aeoess/gateway`.

### Adapters (src/adapters/)

- **`src/adapters/gateway-reporter.ts`** — `reportReceipt`,
  `reportEvaluation`, `GatewayReporterConfig` (type). Subpath-only.
- **`src/adapters/governance-hook.ts`** — `GovernanceHook` (class),
  `GovernanceHookConfig`, `ActionDescriptor`, `GovernanceVerdict`,
  `GovernanceResult`, `GovernanceReceipt` (all types). Subpath-only.

Note: the factory functions `createCrewAIGovernance`,
`createADKGovernancePlugin`, `createLangChainGovernanceHandler`, and
`createA2AGovernance` are **removed entirely** (no stub). Import them
from `@aeoess/gateway` or rebuild using the primitive mappers in
`src/adapters/{crewai,adk,langchain,a2a}.ts` plus `onReceipt`/`onDenied`
callbacks.

### Core runtime (src/core/)

- **`src/core/gateway.ts`** — `ProxyGateway` (class). Subpath-only.
- **`src/core/context.ts`** — `AgentContext` (class), `createAgentContext`.
  Subpath-only.
- **`src/core/data-contribution.ts`** — `createContributionLedger`,
  `recordContribution`, `queryContributions`, `getSourceMetrics`,
  `getAgentDataFootprint`. Subpath-only.
- **`src/core/data-enforcement.ts`** — `DataEnforcementGate` (class).
  **Root-reachable** (exported from `src/index.ts`).
- **`src/core/data-gateway.ts`** — `DataGateway` (class).
  **Root-reachable** (exported from `src/index.ts`).
- **`src/core/data-settlement.ts`** — `generateSettlement`,
  `verifySettlement`, `generateDataComplianceReport`. Subpath-only.
- **`src/core/euaiact.ts`** — `classifyRisk`, `mapArticles`,
  `generateTransparencyDisclosure`, `generateComplianceProfile`,
  `identifyGaps`, `generateComplianceReport`. Subpath-only.
- **`src/core/integration.ts`** — `commerceWithIntent`,
  `commerceReceiptToActionReceipt`, `validateCommerceDelegation`,
  `coordinationToAgora`, `postTaskCreated`, `postReviewCompleted`,
  `postTaskCompleted`. Subpath-only.
- **`src/core/intent-network.ts`** — `createIntentNetwork`,
  `createIntentCard`, `verifyIntentCard`, `isCardExpired`, `publishCard`,
  `removeCard`, `computeRelevance`, `searchMatches`, `requestIntro`,
  `respondToIntro`, `getDigest`, `getVisibleItems`. Subpath-only.
- **`src/core/training-attribution.ts`** — `createTrainingAttribution`,
  `verifyTrainingAttribution`, `createTrainingLedger`,
  `recordTrainingAttribution`, `getModelDataSources`,
  `getSourceTrainingCount`, `createDerivation`, `createDerivationStore`,
  `recordDerivation`, `resolveAttributionChain`. Subpath-only.
- **`src/core/attribution.ts`** — `computeAttribution`,
  `computeCollaborationAttribution`. Pure Merkle primitives
  (`hashReceipt`, `traceBeneficiary`, `verifyAttributionReport`,
  `buildMerkleRoot`, `generateMerkleProof`, `verifyMerkleProof`) stay.
- **`src/core/delegation.ts`** — stateful registry accessors:
  `revokeDelegation`, `cascadeRevoke`, `revokeByAgent`, `validateChain`,
  `getDescendants`, `getChainEntry`, `onRevocation`, `getReceipts`,
  `getRevocation`, `getSpent`. The 8 pure primitives (`createDelegation`,
  `subDelegate`, `verifyDelegation`, `verifyRevocation`, `createReceipt`,
  `verifyReceipt`, `scopeCovers`, `scopeAuthorizes`) are unchanged.
  `clearStores()` is retained as a no-op for test hygiene.

### v2 AMBIGUOUS-split modules (src/v2/)

Stateful functions throw; pure primitives in the same file stay callable.

- **`src/v2/anomaly-v2.ts`** — stubs: `recordV2Action`,
  `getV2ActionHistory`, `getV2AnomalyFlags`, `getV2UnreviewedFlags`,
  `checkV2FirstMaxAuthority`, `computeV2ConcentrationMetrics`,
  `reviewV2AnomalyFlag`, `clearV2AnomalyStores`. Keeps:
  `validateV2UncertaintyCompliance`.
- **`src/v2/attestation-v2.ts`** — stubs: `createV2Attestation`,
  `getV2Attestation`, `getV2AttestationForAction`,
  `getV2AttestationsForAgent`, `getV2AgentAttestationQualityAvg`,
  `clearV2AttestationStore`. Keeps: `signAttestation`,
  `assessV2AttestationQuality`.
- **`src/v2/migration-v2.ts`** — stubs: `requestV2Migration`,
  `approveV2Migration`, `executeV2Migration`, `isV2InProbation`,
  `computeV2MigrationDiscount`, `traceV2MigrationLineage`,
  `rollbackV2Migration`, `processV2CompletedProbations`,
  `getV2MigrationRequest`, `getV2MigrationRecord`,
  `getV2MigrationsForAgent`, `getV2ActiveProbations`,
  `clearV2MigrationStores`. Keeps: `isV2MigrationFactorCompatible`.
- **`src/v2/semantic-drift.ts`** — stubs: `recordSemanticIntent`,
  `analyzeSemanticDrift`, `getDriftResults`, `getAgentDriftAverage`,
  `isAgentSemanticRisk`, `getSemanticRecord`,
  `clearSemanticDriftStores`. Keeps: `extractKeywords`,
  `computeSemanticDrift`, `STOPWORDS`.
- **`src/v2/semantic-scoping.ts`** — stubs: `defineSemanticScope`,
  `checkSemanticCompliance`, `getScopeViolations`,
  `clearSemanticScopingStores`. Keeps: `evaluateSemanticConstraints`,
  plus `SemanticConstraint`, `SemanticScope`, `ScopeViolation` types.

### v2 behavioral analytics — module-level throw (src/v2/)

These 18 files throw at **import time**, not at call time. Any `import`
of the file fails immediately with a migration pointer. There are no
function-level stubs because the modules were moved wholesale.

`affected-party.ts`, `amendment.ts`, `approval-fatigue.ts`,
`blind-evaluation.ts`, `cascade-correlation.ts`, `circuit-breakers.ts`,
`composite-audit.ts`, `cross-chain-audit.ts`, `effect-enforcement.ts`,
`effect-sampling.ts`, `emergence.ts`, `externality.ts`,
`governance-drift.ts`, `inaction-audit.ts`, `output-proportionality.ts`,
`root-transition.ts`, `separation-of-powers.ts`, `values-override.ts`.

### Summary counts

- Files containing `throw new Error(MOVED)` or equivalent: **19**
  (14 function/class stub files + 5 v2 AMBIGUOUS-split files)
- Files that throw at module import: **18** (behavioral analytics)
- Root-reachable stubs (fail at call time via `import … from 'agent-passport-system'`): **2**
  (`DataGateway`, `DataEnforcementGate`)
- Subpath-only stubs (fail at compile time from the root, at call time via
  subpath import): **all others**
