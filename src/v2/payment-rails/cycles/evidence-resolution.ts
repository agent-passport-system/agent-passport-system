// Cycles external-evidence resolution: claimed vs resolved (W2-A2)
// ══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
// A cycles receipt carries a CyclesEvidenceRef: a `cycles_evidence_url`
// plus a CLAIMED content hash `cycles_evidence_id_sha256`. The receipt
// signature covers that claimed hash, so a signature check shows only
// that SOMEONE signed a pointer to a hash. It does NOT show that an
// envelope exists at the URL, nor that the envelope there hashes to the
// claimed value.
//
// This module closes the explicit join-integrity gap (the TODO at
// cycles/index.ts) WITHOUT making the SDK perform network egress. The
// caller supplies an EvidenceResolver (the M3 caller-supplied-resolver
// pattern: an interface that fetches the envelope behind the caller's
// own transport). The resolver returns the fetched envelope bytes; this
// module recomputes the Cycles content-hash recipe (JCS-canonical
// envelope with `evidence_id` AND `signature` emptied, sha256 hex) and
// compares it byte-for-byte against the claimed hash on the receipt.
//
// SECURITY POSTURE (mirrors M3 key-resolution): default fail-closed.
// "Could not fetch the envelope" is never "envelope matched". A
// degraded/unreachable resolution MUST NOT read as resolved=true.
//
// SCOPE: this is an SDK slot/format/hook. It defines the resolver
// INTERFACE, the recompute-and-match operation, and a descriptor INPUT
// the verifier emits. It ships no hosted resolution service, no
// registry, no cross-tenant aggregation, and reaches no global `fetch`
// directly: the egress lives entirely behind the caller's resolver.
