 * null/undefined and any non-conforming shape (non-string elements) pass
 * through unchanged so the strict-JCS null-preservation contract and legacy
 * behavior for out-of-spec input both hold.
 *
 * §4.1 defines scope_required as a duplicate-free array. Duplicates are
 * detected AFTER normalization, so two spellings that collide only under NFC
 * (U+00E9 and "e" + U+0301) reject as well. Rejection rather than dedupe:

/**
 * Compute the content-addressed request identity for an ActionIntent.
 *
 * Inputs hashed: agentId, action.type, action.scopeRequired, normalized timestamp.
 * Timestamp defaults to intent.createdAt; falls back to current time.
 *
 * scopeRequired is canonicalized per draft-pidlisnyi-aps-03 §4.1 before
 * hashing: each scope string is NFC-normalized and, when scopeRequired is an
 * array, the array is sorted by Unicode code point. No case folding; scopes
 * that differ only in case stay distinct.
 *
 * Throws DuplicateScopeRequiredError when an array scopeRequired holds two
 * elements equal after NFC normalization. The throw happens inside
 * canonicalization, before the digest is computed, so a duplicated array can
 * never present as an identity mismatch downstream: there is no action_ref to
 * compare in the first place.
 *
 * Canonicalization follows RFC 8785 JCS strictly, per draft-pidlisnyi-aps-01
 * §4.1: null-valued keys are preserved (not stripped) so that two APS engines
 * independently hashing the same request produce the same action_ref. As of
 * #101 an `undefined` member is rejected rather than coerced to null, because
 * undefined is not a JSON value; a caller that means the JSON null passes an
 * explicit null. This is the pre-draft compatibility digest, not the draft-native
 * aps-action-ref-v2 construction (computeActionRefV2, draft-pidlisnyi-aps-04
 * section 5.1). Cross-ecosystem byte-parity with
 * independent implementations (x402, AgentGraph CTEF, Nobulex) is provided by
 * a separate primitive, computeExternalActionRefV1 in external-action-ref.js,
 * which uses an intentionally different preimage; see that file and
 * docs/specs/action-ref-v1.md.
 *
 * Returns: lowercase hex SHA-256 digest.
